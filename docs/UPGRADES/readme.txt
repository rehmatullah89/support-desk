3. Remove 'control/connect.inc.php' & 'licence.lic' from the new version.

   Note that 'control/connect.inc.php' must be renamed as 'control/connect.php' for later versions.

4. If you added additional priority levels to 'control/priority-levels.php' in v2.1, ensure this file is in your
   installation before you upgrade the database.  This is not required if you are running 2.2 or higher already.

Problems
----------------

If the database update doesn`t work, try it again. Go into your database`s 'msp_settings' table and reset the 'softwareVersion'
value back to the previous version, then re-run the upgrade.

Your servers mysql error log may reveal details of why upgrades are failing. Or check the Maian Support 'logs' folder.
